# Node-CLI-Utility

*UtilityJs* is a general command line utility written in Javascript for the **node.js** runtime. I created it to solve a variety of problems I encountered while developing on OSX / MacOS, and threw in some shiny features just because.

### issues:
* The battery level indicator is broken in the current MacOS release; it will be fixed as soon as I have the time to rewrite some *sed* and *awk* commands.
